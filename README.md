# messengersapi

We have 3 different messaging formats: telegram.json, facebook.json & whatsapp.xml
The goal is to convert each message to an unified message format.

Your tasks are:

* Define a messaging format which makes sense for every provider and includes essential details of every message (you decide which data is essential)
* Assume you already have a working system, a framework which cares about routing, requests, ... Incoming messages are forwarded to a specific function (example: MessageController.php. This is only an example, you neither have to use this boilerplate nor have to use php). Come up with an architecture to convert the messages.
* Your code doesn't need to run or has to be complete. Do as much as you can achieve in 2 hours. If you can't finish parts of your code just describe what these parts should do and how they do it.
* Write a short explanation what you did and why you did it that way.
